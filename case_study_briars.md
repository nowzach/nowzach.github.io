## The question

"You work on a ranch… but *why*?"

Of all the jobs I've worked that have surprised (or confused) old friends in China, this one certainly gets the most questions. 


## My approach

"Laughing Lost in Briars" is a personal experiment in social publishing.

In 2013, I was returning from a break from photography. Not because I believed anyone needed my to see my pictures. Just because I was curious. Here are the high-level questions I was chewing on:

1. How should we use photos now?
2. What sort of visual dialect works on mobile, on social?
3. Who will engage with this project on social – to what end?

These questions already feel a bit retro. When I started this project 6 years ago, it still felt like terra incognita.



## Project details

Now in it's 6th year, Briars is the longest-running documentary project I've ever attempted. To sustain this I use what I've learned from previous big projects: 

- Keep your workflow simple.
- Set up a routine.
- Rely on your routine and workflow when life's demands become otherwise overwhelming.

Photos are shot as JPG, cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic and uploaded to Dropbox before sharing via mobile phone. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

- Photographed from 2013 - present, on the ranch.
- Shared via direct message over multiple platforms. Before I stopped publishing to Instagram in 2018, 170 images from this project had been posted publicly on that platform.


### Atomic unit

New to this project was the 'atomic unit' model. (Here the atomic unit is a 'dairy entry' of a single picture.) By using this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms, i.e. Instagram, WeChat etc? 
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English?
- Scale the project up over time?


> A friend, a designer by trade, first suggested the atomic unit approach to me. Here's a good summation of the atomic unit, applied to design: <http://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design>



## Lessons learned

The atomic unit model has been an invaluable tool for organizing this project.

Although the first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones, I  switched to a secondhand Nikon point and shoot. It has an optical zoom. Most importantly, I can quickly adjust exposure settings using control wheels without having to take off my work gloves. The camera is kept in a ziplock bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case.

When I feel like I can't possibly take one more photo from these same 40 acres, I find inspiration in a notebook filled with Qi Baishi's ink paintings that my old teacher gave to me.

It shouldn't surprise me but I'd hoped – by now – I'd have an easier time defining [nonfiction](https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction.html).
