"Everything you're sure is right can be wrong in another place," observes a character in Barbara Kingsolver's novel, "The Poisonwood Bible."

When you're in "another place," the signal:noise ratio falls through the floor. You're overwhelmed. You're under pressure. Just when you need to think critically about your own assumptions – you can't. Heuristics keep tripping you up.

Questions can help you navigate foreign terrain.

>"What is felt to be a message in one language does not necessarily survive the translation process. Information is more than words: it is words that fit into a cultural framework. Culturally adequate translation is an undervalued art."

> – Geert Hofstede et al, chapter 11 "Intercultural Encounters," _Cultures and Organizations: software of the mind_. (New York: McGraw Hill, 2010), 394.

When you're working across cultures or languages it's important to think about *how* you ask questions. (One of my favorite books on this is Erin Meyer's "The Culture Map." It's well-written, practical and a great starting point for learning more about cross-cultural communication at work.)

For example, in the US and parts of W Europe people expect direct talk: 

+ You ask me a question, and I give you a blunt answer. Culturally, this signals "honesty." That's good!
+ You'll avoid asking about things that are too personal. That'd be rude because you'd embarrass me – or both of us.



Meanwhile, in NE Asia people don't read it that way:

+ You ask me a question, and I avoid responding with a straightforward "no." That'd be rude because I'd embarrass you.
+ You ask about things that are personal but I give you a vague answer. Culturally, this signals "modesty." That's good!



Wherever you're from, you can think of some exceptions to patterns like these. Nevertheless, there are patterns.<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#note-1" alt="footnote">1</a></sup> The questions we ask each other are built on top of our cultural expectations about how somebody "should" communicate.

Be aware of context.

Your cultural background underpins your personal communication style.<sup><a id="ref-2" href="#note-2" alt="footnote">2</a></sup> You get input and feedback for what works starting when you're a baby. By the time you're grown, you can efficently make inferences about a person's intentions, based in part on the way that person talks to you. And you make day-to-day assumptions about how their communication habits "must" reflect a person's moral character, reliability, whatever.<sup><a id="ref-3" href="#note-3" alt="footnote">3</a></sup>

It's messy. It's quick. It's how people work.

What happens when you aren't in your day-to-day, though?

Direct talk will have the opposite effect you want if you are an American in NE Asia. The careful posturing that works so well at home won't have the same appeal in "another place." You won't come off as a confident straight shoooter. You'll come off as juvenile, incompetent or hard to work with.

Context can be complicated, obviously. Maybe you're traveling in Seoul or Shenzhen. Maybe you need to ask a few questions. Maybe appealing to people's sense of pity will get you just the answer you need to unstick that confusing conversation.

You'll just have to ask, and find out.



### Notes

#### Note 1

Start with Meina Liu's "Verbal Communication styles and culture" in [Oxford Research Encyclopedias.](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.162)

#### Note 2

Read Andy Molinsky's "Cultural Differences Are More Complicated than What Country You’re From," in [HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/01/cultural-differences-are-more-complicated-than-what-country-youre-from) for some practical ideas.

Read Tarun Khanna's "Contextual Intelligence," also in [HBR.](https://hbr.org/2014/09/contextual-intelligence) It isn't a hard left turn, even though it'll feel like it when you click. Khanna's piece will help you start mulling over just how hard it can be to grok culture's influence over your workaday perception of the world - because, if you're anything like me, a clear application to an abstract problem is motivating.

If you've got access to an academic library, check out Christine Béal's classic paper, "Did you have a good weekend: or, why there is no such thing as a simple question in cross-cultural encounters." The abstract is available on [ResearchGate.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234558796_Did_You_Have_a_Good_Weekend_Or_Why_There_Is_No_Such_Thing_as_a_Simple_Question_in_Cross-Cultural_Encounters)

#### Note 3

>"When two actors meet who have different models for recognizing and dealing with these sorts of problems, and when their respective models are backed up in their eyes by some special authority, authenticity, or feeling of rightness that may range all the way from ecclesiastical or sacred morality to self-evident common sense, *then* we may begin to speak of cultural difference."
>
>"Notice that culture appears as a sort of optical or perceptual illusion here: although always a presence, it can best be seen when thrown into relief by the quality of *difference*. For if two actors meet who share the same model or schema for dealing with, say, the power asymmetry evident between them, then culture is invisible, part of and buried in the deepest, and in this case, shared, context of their encounter."
