Updated: {% include print_update.html %} • Snapshot of how I'm spending my time, where I'm going and what I'm using to make stuff. I write this down for myself, because it helps me take stock and stay oriented while navigating the day-to-day. Shared here because you're curious.



## Ongoing and upcoming


Neighbor's bull got out and went for a ramble. This was as good of a reminder as any that fall is a great time to check fences at the ranch.

Researching [updates](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/index.html#book-updates) for The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing. Expect version 2 before the end of the year.



## Reading

**To read:** Hidalgo's "Why Information Grows"

**Reading:** binge-watching PBS "Eons," really

**Done reading:** Klement's "When Coffee and Kale Compete"



## Email newsletters that get opened every time

+ [Chinese Storytellers](https://chinesestorytellers.substack.com)
+ Craig Mod's [Ridgeline](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/)
+ Julie Zhuo's [The Looking Glass](https://juliezhuo.com/design/mailinglist.html)



## Tools I'm using now

Whenever I travel, visit a friend, or read a bit of [anthropology,](https://archive.org/details/StoneAgeEconomics_201611/page/n31) it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?

*HT [Belle Cooper](http://bellebcooper.com/) for inspiring the idea for a now page and tools list.*

### Changes

Using [Orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) again. It is too good to quit!

Back on an official build of Android because I needed a new phone with wider LTE radio support. Previously, I ran a de-Googled build of LineageOS.



### Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) Chinese dictionary and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.



### Organization

+ _todo.txt
+ Analog – and a bit borked – kanban using sticky notes and a white board; previously, Trello
+ Orgzly
+ Peter Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com) helps me manage my picture archive.
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based tasks, except writing



### Office stuff

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ G Suite
+ macOS
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ Standing desk and headphone music
+ Storage drives are whatever The Wirecutter [recommends](https://thewirecutter.com/electronics/storage-devices/)


#### Production for web and ebook

+ BBEdit
+ Calibre
+ GIF Brewery
+ Github
+ imageMagick
+ imageOptim
+ Pandoc
+ TextEdit

*More [details.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html)*



### Phone essentials

+ [NetGuard](https://www.netguard.me/)
+ Orgzly
+ Pleco Chinese dictionary
+ [RadarScope](https://www.radarscope.app/)
+ [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

*Because I spend a lot of time outside, I want a phone that is lightweight and pocket-sized. It should be durable-ish. It should get routine security patches. Motorola's low-end Android phones are the closest thing I've found.*



### Photo

+ Camera hardware varies by project; small and simple is good 
+ JPG soc when the project allows for it
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter paired with Silver Efex Pro for digital BW images



### Field and ranch

Boots are my most important tool outdoors. I often wear Belleville Mini-Mil boots, which I bought after reading [this.](https://chasingyourmind.blogspot.com/2014/11/minimal-boots-and-belleville-mini-mil.html)


#### WX and climate

+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ RadarScope app
+ [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)
