Updated: {% include print_update.html %} â€¢ Right now, I'm pulling at a Blacklegged [tick.] I've been down in the bottomlands, clearing brush and fixing fence before the poison ivy leafs out. Spring is already here, and I love that.

Since you were last here at `/now`, I've published v2 of my [field guide.] With that out of the way:

- I've got one eye on catching up on the stuff that had to wait till the book was done, like bringing more automation into my photo workflow; 
- And I'm looking ahead for a few good challenges in 2020 to sink my teeth into. It's going to be a big year. I can smell it `:)`
