## Your privacy


### Your data

You'll find that this website has only 1 cookie, Cloudflare's `__cfduid` cookie. If you're curious about what it does, start with [this.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-)

I don't collect user data. I don't track your clicks. I don't use affiliate links.


### Our correspondence

Whenever possible I delete ephemeral correspondence immediately. However, you should *also* know that:

1. US regulations do require that I retain some business-related correspondence for several years.
2. Because I'm human I do take notes for myself. Because I'm human, I keep my digital notes encrypted. ðŸ™Š



## Technical ingredients

+ Built on Github Pages
+ Served over Cloudflare's CDN
+ Email correspondence by Google GSuite

I want this site to work for you. Even if you're on an old phone. Even when you're standing outside an airport waiting for the bus. Even when the library wi-fi is slow as hell.
