## Your privacy

Privacy matters to me and I bet it matters to you, too. 


### Your data

I don't collect user data. I don't track your clicks. I don't use affiliate links.

You'll find that this website has only 1 cookie, Cloudflare's `__cfduid` cookie. If you're curious about what it does, start with [this.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-)



### Our correspondence

+ I do not sell or share your email address.
+ If you sign up for email updates, I keep that email address so I can send you updates. And if you unsubscribe, I delete your email address.
+ Whenever possible I delete ephemeral correspondence immediately. However, you should *also* know that:
 1. US regulations do require that I retain some business-related correspondence for several years.
 2. Because I'm human I do take notes for myself. And, because I'm human, I keep my digital notes, contacts and calendar data encrypted. ðŸ™Š



## Technical ingredients

+ Built on Github Pages
+ Served over Cloudflare's CDN
+ Email signup via Formspree.io
+ Email correspondence by Google GSuite

I want this site to work for you. Even if you're on an old phone. Even when you're standing outside an airport waiting for the bus. Even when the library wi-fi is slow as hell.
