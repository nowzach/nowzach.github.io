## 3 strategies

+ Ask, don't assume: e.g., to avoid confusion right now
+ Ask differently: e.g., to make room for new info
+ Ask again: e.g., to avoid confusion later on




## Prep in 3 steps 

Be aware of context.

1. What do you know about the person you'll be asking?
2. What are you *assuming* with your question?
3. What's your goal with this question?



## Then, ask in 3 steps

4. Spend most of your energy listening.
5. Make space, and wait for an answer.
6. Keep track of your goal during the conversation.

After an emotionally-draining conversation, it can be very helpful to remind yourself that you were able to navigate the tricky bits and obtain whatever it is you went in there asking about.



## Ask with empathy

A problem with "lazy" questions is that, to the person receiving your question, there is no empathy in what you've asked. You need to engage your listener – not leaving them wondering if you did your homework.

Frame your question in a way that brings the other person into what you're thinking. This might make you feel extra vulnerable but it won't leave your listener with the impression that you're question is unconsidered.



## Ante up to ask

Yes, asking a "dumb" question feels awkward *right now*. It's worth the emotional risk because your question is a chance to get better info, to build rapport or – at the very least – a chance to suss out the person you're querying.

A question can be a very useful tool for building trust. But, first, you'll have to ante up.
