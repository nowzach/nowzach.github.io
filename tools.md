## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco] and [Photo Mechanic] for over a decade. Peter Krogh's [The DAM Book] has been helping me manage my picture archive for at least that long.

Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read a bit of [archaeology,] it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
