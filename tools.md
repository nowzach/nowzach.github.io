I've been using [Pleco] and [Photo Mechanic] for over a decade. Peter Krogh's [The DAM Book] has been helping me manage my picture archive for at least that long.

## Office

+ AP Stylebook from 2009
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ Plain TXT, please; currently I'm using [Markor] and [FX] on Android and, as always, TextEdit on MacOS

Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read a bit of [archaeology,] it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
