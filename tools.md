## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.




## Changes

**inbox.google.com**â€¦ Google giveth and Google taketh away.

**Wire**â€¦ testing out the Berlin-based messaging app.

**Orgzly**â€¦ lovely UX on Android but also trapped on Android because â€“ I guess â€“ I'm not going to use terminal and emacs. ðŸ˜œ After my phone died, it was time to find something cross-platform. Still looking. Send help!

**Photo Mechanic v6**â€¦ excited to test out the new version but it'll have to wait awhile.
