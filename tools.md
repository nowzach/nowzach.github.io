## Longevity

For the last 17 years, I've been using .TXT on macOS to write anything longer than a note. Nice and simple. I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.




## Changes

**inbox.google.com**… The Goog giveth and the Goog taketh away.

**Wire**… testing out the Berlin-based messaging app.

**Orgzly**… lovely UX on Android but also trapped on Android because, I guess, I'm just not l33t enough to use terminal and emacs to check my todo list on my computer ;p After my phone died, it was time to find something cross-platform. Still looking. Send help!

**Photo Mechanic v6**… excited to test out the new version but it'll have to wait awhile.



## Organization

+ _todo.txt via [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ Android, de-Googled
+ Sticky note triage, prev Orgzly
+ Pomodoro technique &sup1;

<small>Note 1: Pomodoro for screen-based tasks, at least. Writing gets more time because it takes me that long to build momentum.</small>



## Office

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ Dropbox
+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ Github
+ G Suite
+ macOS running on a geriatric MBP with a rando monitor
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ TextEdit



## Photo

+ imageMagick
+ imageOptim
+ Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com)
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter, particularly for BW images
+ Silver Effex Pro



## Field

+ Always looking for a better hat
+ Bates boots, usually
+ Billhook
+ Bull nose pliers
+ Coolmax UV Buff around my neck &sup2;
+ Dish soap to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak
+ [mobile.weather.gov](https://mobile.weather.gov/)
+ Sharpie and Tyvek &sup3;


<small>Note 2: In the summer, an old, black cotton tshirt breathes better and protects more of your neck. (Cut off just below the sleeves into a loop, and fold the fabric over onto itself at least twice to stop some sun.)</small>

<small>Note 3: When it's 100F and humid, and even your pockets are sweaty, an old Tyvek shipping envelope works better than paper.</small>
