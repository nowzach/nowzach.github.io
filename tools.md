## Changes

New phone – another Motorola – because it has wider LTE radio support. Back on an official build of Android. Previously on a de-Googled build of LineageOS.

Using [Orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) again. It is too good to quit!



## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade. Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com) has helped me manage my picture archive since 2006.



## Organization

+ _todo.txt via [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ Borked kanban using sticky notes and a white board; previously, Trello
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Orgzly
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based tasks, except writing



## Office

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ Github
+ G Suite
+ macOS running on an old MBP; I did eventually install an SDD and a new battery
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ Standing desk
+ Storage drives are whatever The Wirecutter tells me to buy
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ TextEdit
+ [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)



## Phone

+ Android
+ [NetGuard](https://www.netguard.me/)
+ Orgzly
+ Pleco
+ [Radarscope](https://www.radarscope.app/)
+ Standard Notes
+ [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
+ [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

*Both for fun and for work, I spend a lot of time outside. I want a phone that is very lightweight and cheap. It should be durable-ish. It should get routine security patches and have good call quality. The Moto e5 Play is the closest thing I've found.*



## Photo

+ Canon, Nikon, etc; I buy all my lenses and camera bodies secondhand
+ [GIF Brewery 3](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery)
+ imageMagick
+ imageOptim
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Pelican Case
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter, particularly for BW images
+ Sandisk Extreme Pro cards, mostly
+ Silver Effex Pro



## Field

+ Always looking for a better hat
+ Bates boots, usually
+ Billhook
+ Bull nose pliers
+ Coolmax UV Buff around my neck
+ Dish soap to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak keeps dust, rain and sweat away from my phone


**HT [Belle B Cooper](http://bellebcooper.com/) for inspiring the idea for a tools list. She is a formidable talent.**

Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read a bit of [archaeology,](https://archive.org/details/StoneAgeEconomics_201611/page/n31) it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
