*HT [Belle B Cooper](http://bellebcooper.com/) for inspiring the idea for a tools list.*

Whenever I travel, visit a friend, or read a bit of [archaeology,](https://archive.org/details/StoneAgeEconomics_201611/page/n31) it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
