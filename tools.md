A partial list of tools for my friends and fellow makers of stuff. Some are favorites, others are well-used and a few I don't even like but they still get the job done.

## Changes

New phone because it has wider LTE radio support. Back on an official build of Android. Previously running a de-Googled build of LineageOS.

Using [Orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) again. It is too good to quit!



## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade. Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com) has helped me manage my picture archive since 2006.



## Organization

+ _todo.txt via [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ Borked kanban using sticky notes and a white board; previously, Trello
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Orgzly
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based tasks, except writing



## Office

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ G Suite… for now
+ macOS running on an old MBP; I did eventually install an SDD and a new battery
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ Standing desk
+ TextEdit


### Book and web

+ BBEdit
+ Calibre
+ [GIF Brewery 3](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery)
+ Github

### WX

+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ [RadarScope](https://www.radarscope.app/)
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)



## Phone

+ Android

+ [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

*Because I spend a lot of time outside, I want a phone that is lightweight and pocket-sized. It should be durable-ish. It should get routine security patches. Specs aren't a priority to me but the phone does need to have radio and mic hardware that is good enough to sustain call quality that doesn't annoy my clients. Over the last several years, finding a phone that ticks all these boxes has become more challenging. Motorola's low-end phones are closest thing I've found.*


## Photo

+ Canon, Nikon, etc; I buy all my lenses and camera bodies secondhand
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter, particularly for BW images
+ Sandisk Extreme Pro cards, mostly
+ Silver Effex Pro
+ Storage drives are whatever The Wirecutter recommends


## Field

+ Always looking for a better hat
+ Bates boots, usually
+ Billhook
+ Bull nose pliers
+ Coolmax UV Buff around my neck
+ Dish soap to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak bags keep dust and rain away from my phone
+ PPE: WalMart does a great job with RX safety glasses – they are affordable and make them fast

Whenever I travel, visit a friend, or read a bit of [archaeology,](https://archive.org/details/StoneAgeEconomics_201611/page/n31) it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
