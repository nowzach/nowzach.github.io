Updated: {{ page.date | date: "%b %d %Y" }}

A partial list of tools for my friends and fellow makers of stuff. Some are favorites, others are well-used and a few I don't even like but still get the job done.

+ [Organization](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html#organization) 
+ [Office](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html#office)
+ [Phone](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html#phone)
+ [Photo](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html#photo)
+ [Field](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html#field)



## Changes

New phone because it has wider LTE radio support. Back on an official build of Android. Previously, I ran a de-Googled build of LineageOS.

Using [Orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) again. It is too good to quit!



## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.



## Organization

+ _todo.txt
+ Borked kanban using sticky notes and a white board; previously, Trello
+ Orgzly
+ Peter Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com) helps me manage my picture archive.
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based tasks, except writing



## Office stuff

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ G Suite
+ macOS
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ Standing desk
+ TextEdit


### Production for ebooks and web

+ BBEdit
+ Calibre
+ [GIF Brewery 3](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery)
+ Github
+ imageMagick
+ imageOptim
+ Pandoc

*If you're curious, here are more [details.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html)*


### Weather

+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ [RadarScope](https://www.radarscope.app/)
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)



## Phone

+ Android
+ [NetGuard](https://www.netguard.me/)
+ Orgzly
+ Pleco
+ RadarScope
+ [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
+ [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

*Because I spend a lot of time outside, I want a phone that is lightweight and pocket-sized. It should be durable-ish. It should get routine security patches. Motorola's low-end phones are closest thing I've found.*


## Photo

+ Canon, Nikon, etc; I prefer to buy my lenses and camera bodies secondhand
+ Krogh's The DAM Book
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter, particularly for BW images
+ Sandisk Extreme Pro cards
+ Silver Effex Pro
+ Storage drives are whatever The Wirecutter recommends


## Field

+ Always looking for a better hat
+ Boots are my most important tools for outdoor work and, depending on the task, I wear:
  + Belleville Mini-Mil, after reading [this](https://chasingyourmind.blogspot.com/2014/11/minimal-boots-and-belleville-mini-mil.html)
  + USMC hot weather issue via EBay; I've been happy with the Bates and Altama iterations
  + Cheap muck boots
+ Billhook, which gets my vote as the most versitle and underrated tool on this list
+ Dish soap to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak bags
+ RX safety glasses; WalMart does a great job with these



*HT [Belle B Cooper](http://bellebcooper.com/) for inspiring the idea for a tools list.*

Whenever I travel, visit a friend, or read a bit of [anthropology,](https://archive.org/details/StoneAgeEconomics_201611/page/n31) it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
