## Longevity

For the last 17 years, I've been using .TXT on macOS to write anything longer than a note. Nice and simple. I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.




## Changes

**inbox.google.com**… The Goog giveth and the Goog taketh away.

**Wire**… testing out the Berlin-based messaging app.

**Orgzly**… lovely UX on Android but also trapped on Android because, I guess, I'm just not l33t enough to use terminal and emacs to check my todo list on my computer ;p After my phone died, it was time to find something cross-platform. Still looking. Send help!

**Photo Mechanic v6**… excited to test out the new version but it'll have to wait awhile.



## Organization

+ _todo.txt via [Standard Notes](https://www.standardnotes.org)
+ Android, de-Googled
+ Sticky note triage, prev Orgzly
+ Pomodoro technique \&ast;\

&ast; For nearly all screen-based tasks, at least. Writing gets more time because it takes me that long to build momentum.



## Office

+ AP Stylebook, circa 2009
+ Dropbox
+ [droughtmonitor.unl.edu](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX)
+ Github
+ G Suite
+ macOS running on a geriatric MBP with a rando monitor
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl
+ [texaswildfirerisk.com](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/Map/Public/)
+ TextEdit



## Photo

+ imageMagick
+ imageOptim
+ Krogh's [The DAM Book](https://www.thedambook.com)
+ Photo Mechanic
+ [RPP](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com) converter, particularly for BW images
+ Silver Effex Pro



## Field

+ Always looking for a better hat
+ Bates boots, usually
+ Billhook
+ Bull nose pliers
+ Coolmax UV Buff around my neck \&ast;&ast;\
+ Dish soap to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak
+ [mobile.weather.gov](https://mobile.weather.gov/)
+ Sharpie and Tyvek \&ast;&ast;&ast;\


\&ast;&ast;\ But in the summer: an old, black cotton tshirt breathes better and protects more of your neck. (Cut off just below the sleeves into a loop, and fold the fabric over onto itself at least twice to stop some sun.)

\&ast;&ast;&ast;\ When it's 100F and humid, and even your pockets are sweaty, an old Tyvek shipping envelope works better than paper.

_Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read about some random, new archeology find, it is always the stuff people use that makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh? HT [Belle B Cooper](http://bellebcooper.com/) for inspiring the idea for a tools list. She is a formidable talent._
