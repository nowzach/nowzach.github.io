*Figuring I could be a useful human by putting my cameras to work, I jumped into photography by hiring myself out to NGO clients. I had a lot to learn. Here are a few notes to my younger self.*



## Brass tacks, tactfully

You seem savvy enough to know that there is more to this work than good intentions. Nevertheless, it is a messy business. Hash out expectations with your client as early as possible.



## Always bring extra

Bring enough snacks to share with grouchy coworkers and rogue livestock. Also, are you wearing pants? Good. Put a freshly charged camera battery in your right pocket. Spent batteries go in your left pocket.



## Don't look away

Give your subject respect. Give your clients and their audience an honest story. You don't need to give the cynics anything.



## Really, it is *your* job to smile

Build rapport before you photograph.



## Always be improvising

Don't worry if you'll have enough time, enough light or enough coverage â€“ you won't. Just keep your lens clean and take your vitamins. Then, channel Bruce Lee.



## Be someone to lean on

Field managers can juggle tasks like a superhero but even they can't read minds. Trust is a two-way street. Communicate often and navigate by asking better questions.



## Debriefing isn't therapy

There is an emotional cost to this work. Create, and keep, rituals for yourself to process your experience. Don't be afraid to ask for help.



## Godspeed

These are things we all have to learn by doing, I think. Just know that you're not the first photographer to face these challenges.
