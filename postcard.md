*Figuring I could be a useful human by putting my cameras to work, I jumped into photography by hiring myself out to NGO clients. I had a lot to learn. Here are a few notes to my younger self.*



## Brass tacks, tactfully

You seem savvy enough to know that there is more to this work than good intentions. Nevertheless, it is a messy business. Hash out expectations with your client as early as possible. The relationship between NGOs and the independent press is complicated. You need to be aware of your role -- and limitations -- within the larger, international media supply chain.



## Always bring extra

Bring enough snacks to share with grouchy coworkers and rogue livestock. Also, are you wearing pants? Good. Put a freshly charged camera battery in your right pocket. Spent batteries go in your left pocket.



## Don't look away

Give your subject respect. Give your clients and their audience an honest story. You don't need to give the cynics anything.



## Really, it is *your* job to smile

Build rapport before you photograph.



## Always be improvising

Don't worry if you'll have enough time, enough light or enough coverage – you won't. Keep your lens clean and take your vitamins. Then, channel Bruce Lee. You'll get it done.



## Be someone to lean on

Field managers can juggle tasks like a superhero but even they can't read minds. Trust is a two-way street. Communicate often and navigate by asking [better questions.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/just-ask.html)



## WYSIATI

["What you see is all there is."] When you're working in someone else's culture, this will get you into trouble. Said another way:

["What you see is all there is."]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems

> "Observation across cultures is notoriously difficult..."

> "...there is a great deal you will be unable to see, whether or not you're in the proper state to observe. The trouble is that you will not be able to see anything that does not constitute *meaningful behavior* in your own culture. You must remember in this context that it is not the eyes that see but the mind. The eyes merely convey images to the mind, which then interprets and confers meaning on those images it recognizes, things it has 'seen' before, and confers no meaning on – and therefore does not see – anything it does not recognize."

## Post-processing

There is an emotional cost to this work. It's stressful. Always create, and keep, rituals for yourself to process your experience. Don't be afraid to ask for help.



## Godspeed

These are things we all have to learn by doing, I think. Just know that you're not the first photographer to face these challenges.
