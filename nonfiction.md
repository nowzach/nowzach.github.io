## 5 questions to ask

Forget about Photoshop. Don't worry about deep fakes. The real question isn't about techno-phantoms. The real question is the same as always: *who trusts you?*

These are the questions I've been taught to ask. These are also the questions I trust my clients, editors and audience to ask my pictures.

+ Where is it published?
+ Why publish it now?
+ Who made it, and who is it for?
+ How can I verify it?
+ What did it cost, and what's the payoff?



## Working definition

She is surprisingly difficult to photograph.

You need a picture that reads. Right now my composition does not read "Giant Walking Stick." Right now the picture is just a mess of tree bark.

She moves so slowly. She barely moves at all, other than to mimic the swaying oak leaves as the breeze picks up. 

It's going to storm.

Here underneath the tree canopy it's already too dark for photos – shooting at 1/10 of a second I can't get my shutter speed up fast enough to stop the insect's gentle swaying motions. I've only got about 2 minutes, I bet, before the storm sweeps in between me and the sun to block last bit of dusk light. Another 2 minutes after that, the storm will arrive and I'll wish I wasn't outside at all.

I grab the penlight from my pocket, click it on and hold it in my teeth. The trick to photographing any well-camouflaged creature is to visually separate your subject from the background.

To get this picture I'm going to need more light on the insect:

+ to bring up my shutter speed to at least 1/30 of a second
+ to pull her out from the background


But a quick test proves that tactic won't work this time. How am I going to get a usable image?

I'm heat drunk and tired from working outside all day. I can't think. Time is running out.

A few fat rain drops start falling, and it smells like dust and acorns. I gently pick up the creature and let her crawl along my arm. She is bigger than I expected.

This is the first time I've even seen a stick insect.

"You doin' ok, mama?" I ask her. She replies by pacing up and down my arm looking for an escape route, so I set her on a convenient (convenient for me) oak limb where she hangs, upside down.

But, hang on, *this* could work as a picture: I could frame the insect in profile, hanging upside down from the lichen-flecked oak limb, which is thicker around than my thigh. She will pop out from the background and maybe the image will finally read "Giant Walking Stick."

I hunch down and try to steady the shot between wind gusts and my own breath.

Immediately it all feels wrong.

Spitting the penlight out of my mouth and swearing at myself in the dark, I carefully pick the insect up again and return her to her original perch. I delete the photos.

The wind is tearing through the oak canopies with violence now. I stand there watching the stick insect climb up. Up, until the dark hides her. How many of these trees have their own creatures?

Rain crashes down and wets my neck well before I make it to my car.



## WTF is nonfiction, tho

It is about the relationship between photographer, photographed and audience. Who trusts you to point that camera in the right direction?

Is the problem that Art Wolfe's "Migration" was [PhotoShopped,](https://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/dec98/wolfe4.html) or the way he responded to criticism, or the way he captioned his images?

"Photographs quote from appearances. The taking-out of the quotation produces a discontinuity, which is reflected in the ambiguity of a photograph's meaning. All photographed events are ambiguous, except to those whose personal relation to the event is such that their own lives supply the missing continuity. Usually, in public the ambiguity of photographs is hidden by the use of words which explain, less or more truthfully, the pictured events."

 – John Berger, "Appearances," *Another Way of Telling* by Berger and Mohr (New York: Vintage International, 1982), 128. 

If Marcio Cabral's [anteater](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/Wildlife-Photographer-of-the-Year/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-image-disqualified.html) is fraud, why is Robert Dosineau's [kiss](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170213-the-iconic-photo-that-symbolises-love) so easy to forgive? Seems worth chewing on for a bit. It doesn't go down easy. I don't think it is meant to. Food for thought:

+ [Reuters Handbook](http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=A_Brief_Guide_to_Standards,_Photoshop_and_Captions)
+ An open letter from photographer [Bruce Percy](https://www.brucepercy.co.uk/blog/2017/5/22/photographers-code-of-conduct)
