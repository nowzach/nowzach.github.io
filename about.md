description: About Zach

---



I'm a ranch hand. Also, I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.

You can take a peek at the [tools](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html) I use to make stuff.


[hello@zachmccabe.com](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com)



## Where I work

My clients and friends are worldwide. I'm based in Texas.



## Where I have experience

North America and East Asia are where I have the most experience:

  + Worked with small, remote teams across 12 timezones
  + Began my career working as a [photographer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) in the PRC and HK
  + Grew up in the US, China and Japan

Because life is deliciously weird, I've had the privilege of contributing to projects in some of the world's biggest cities, in the backcountry, and a few places in between, too.

When I moved away after 2nd grade, my friend Brad updated me on the summer's adventures via cassette tape recordings he made and sent in the mail. That left a mark! I'm always working to improve my [communications skills](https://www.zachmccabe.com/just_ask.html) and toolkit.
