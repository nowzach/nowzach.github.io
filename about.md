**Hi. It's Zach.**

I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.
](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing.html)

The guide is my attempt to give something back to the creative community. It's also an [experiment](https://www.zachmccabe.com/bullshit.html) in digital publishing.




## My story

I grew up in the US, China and Japan. 

After being accepted into architecture school, I took a deep breath and declined. Instead I went to study Chinese in Minnesota and at Shanghai's Huashida.

I got my start making [photos](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) for NGO clients in East Asia.

Now I'm in Texas. I work as a ranch hand when I'm not debugging the field guide. You can probably find me outside, either way. üçÉ Sunshine is good stuff.
