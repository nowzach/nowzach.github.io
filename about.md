# Hi, it's Zach

I'm a ranch hand. Also, I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.

You can take a peek at the [tools](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html) I'm using to make stuff right now.

## Where I work

Currently I'm based in Texas â€“ just down the road from DFW Airport. My clients and friends are worldwide.



## Where I have experience

North America and East Asia are where I have the most experience.

  + I began my career working as a [photographer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) in the PRC and HK.
  + I grew up in the US, China and Japan.

Because life is deliciously weird, I've had the privilege of contributing to projects in some of the world's biggest cities, in the backcountry, and a few places in between, too.



## Remote work

I have experience collaborating with small teams across 10-12 timezones.

When I moved away after 2nd grade, my friend Brad updated me on the summer's adventures via cassette tape recordings he made and sent in the mail. That left a mark. I'm always working to improve my [communications skills](https://www.zachmccabe.com/ask_dumb_questions.html) and toolkit.
