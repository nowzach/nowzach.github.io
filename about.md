## Who I work with

Let's make something! I welcome collaborations, commissions and new clients. [hello@zachmccabe.com](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com)




## What I do

I'm an optimist: I believe all ideas begin with bullshit, and then you [iterate.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/bullshit.html)

I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing. I used to write about photography for [Empty Easel.](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A+emptyeasel.com+zach+mccabe) Before that, I worked as a photographer for NGO clients.

For many years I've also worked as a ranch hand. üçÉ This area is the location of my ongoing photo project, "Laughing Lost in Briars."

You can take a peek at ongoing and upcoming [projects,](https://www.zachmccabe.com/now.html#ongoing-and-upcoming) or check out the tools I'm using [now.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/now.html#tools-im-using-now)



## Where I work

Currently I'm just down the road from DFW Airport in Texas. My clients and friends are worldwide.


### Where I have experience

North America and East Asia are where I have the most experience:
  + Collaborated on remote projects across 12 timezones.
  + Began my career working as a [photographer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) for clients in the PRC and HK.
  + Grew up in the US, China and Japan.

Because life is deliciously weird, I've had the privilege of contributing to projects in some of the world's biggest cities, in the backcountry and a few places in between. I'm always working to improve my [communications skills](https://www.zachmccabe.com/just_ask.html) and toolkit.
