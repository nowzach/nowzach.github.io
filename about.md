## Hi, it's Zach

This website is for friends, clients and curious internet strangers. You can check the [now page](https://www.zachmccabe.com/now.html) for the latest.



## My field guide

I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.
](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing)

The field guide is my attempt to give something back to the creative community. It's also an [experiment](https://www.zachmccabe.com/bullshit.html) in digital publishing.



## My story

I grew up in the US, China and Japan. 

After studying Chinese in Minnesota and at Shanghai‚Äôs Huashida, I got my start making [photos](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) for NGO clients in East Asia.

Currently I live in Texas. I work as a ranch hand when I'm not debugging the field guide. You can probably find me outside, either way. üçÉ Sunshine is good stuff.
