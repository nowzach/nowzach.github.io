**Hi. It's Zach.** You can use this website to see what I'm up to [now.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/now.html) Or, keep reading to learn more about me.

## Who I work with

Let's make something! I welcome collaborations, commissions and new clients. [hello@zachmccabe.com](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com)




## What I do

I'm an optimist: I believe all ideas begin with bullshit, and then you [iterate.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/bullshit.html)

I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of "The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing." I used to write about photography for [Empty Easel.](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A+emptyeasel.com+zach+mccabe) Before that, I worked as a photographer for NGO clients.

The focus of my photographic work is long-term projects and image libraries; most is documentary [nonfiction.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction.html)

For many years I've also worked as a ranch hand. I'm a big fan of sunshine. üçÉ The experience ‚Äì and the confusion it causes my friends ‚Äì is the force behind my ongoing photo project, "Laughing Lost in Briars."



## Where I work

Currently I'm just down the road from DFW Airport in Texas. My clients and friends are worldwide.


### Remote work

I have experience collaborating with small teams across 12 timezones. üìÆ When I moved away after 2nd grade, my friend Brad sent me summer dispatches via cassette tape recordings he made and sent in the mail. That left a mark. I'm always working to improve my [communications skills](https://www.zachmccabe.com/just_ask.html) and toolkit.


### Where I have experience

North America and East Asia are where I have the most experience:
  + I began my career working as a [photographer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) for clients in the PRC and HK.
  + After acceptance into architecture school, I took a deep breath, declined and went to a liberal arts college to study Chinese instead.
  + I grew up in the US, China and Japan.

Because life is deliciously weird, I've had the privilege of contributing to projects in some of the world's biggest cities, in the backcountry and a few places in between.
