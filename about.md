---



I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing. The book is a mobile-first project you to read on your trip.

Also, I'm a ranch hand.

You can take a peek at the [tools](https://www.zachmccabe.com/tools.html) I use to make stuff.


## Work


### Where I work

My clients and friends are worldwide. I'm based in Texas.


### Where I have experience

North America and East Asia are where I have the most experience:

  + I began my career working as a [photographer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) in the PRC and HK.
  + I grew up in the US, China and Japan.

Because life is deliciously weird, I've had the privilege of contributing to projects in some of the world's biggest cities, in the backcountry, and a few places in between, too.


### Remote work

  + I have experience collaborating with small, project-based teams across 12 timezones.

When I moved away after 2nd grade, my friend Brad updated me on the summer's adventures via cassette tape recordings he made and sent in the mail. That left a mark! I'm always working to improve my [communications skills](https://www.zachmccabe.com/just_ask.html) and toolkit.
