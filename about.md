## Why I wrote a field guide

I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.]

The field guide is my attempt to give something back to the creative community. You can read this [FAQ] for more.

## My story

Currently I live in Texas. I work as a ranch hand when I'm not debugging the field guide. You can probably find me outside, either way. üçÉ Sunshine is good stuff.

After studying Chinese in Minnesota and at Shanghai‚Äôs Huashida, I got my start making [photos] for NGO clients in East Asia.

I grew up in the US, China and Japan.
