**Hi. It's Zach.**

I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.
](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing.html)

The guide is my attempt to give something back to the creative community. It's also an [experiment](https://www.zachmccabe.com/bullshit.html) in digital publishing.




## My story

I grew up in the US, China and Japan. 

My undergraduate degree is in East Asian Studies. I got my start making [photos](https://www.zachmccabe.com/postcard.html) for NGO clients in that region.

For many years I‚Äôve also worked as a ranch hand in Texas. üçÉ Sunshine is good.
