"Make a [bold hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold_hypothesis) and disprove it" – Karl Popper

**bullshit > create > iterate**

Recently I keep having conversations with folks who seem to be afraid of their own imaginations. You know? So, I'm writing the following list to remind myself *why* I believe you and I both need bullshit. I won't claim it’s original.

1. If you don't value your idea, neither will anyone else.
2. Just because you value your idea doesn't make it valuable (to your friends, clients, lovers).
3. Always iterate, because your idea is bullshit.

Good things grow in manure. Take a guess, roll up your sleeves and bullshit me.
