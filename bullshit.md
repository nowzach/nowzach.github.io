"Make a [bold hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold_hypothesis) and disprove it" – Karl Popper

**bullshit > create > iterate**

Recently it feels like I keep having conversations with folks who are afraid of their own imaginations. You know? I'm writing the following list to remind *myself* why I believe you and I both need bullshit. I won't claim it’s original.

1. If you don't value your idea, neither will anyone else.
2. Just because you value your idea doesn't make it valuable to others.
3. Always iterate, because your idea is bullshit.

Heads up: value &ne; profit. Even if, in our paradigm, profit is often the only agreed-on standard used to measure value. "Hold a hammer, and all you'll see are nails."

Good things grow out of manure. Keep at it.
