Make a [bold hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold_hypothesis) and disprove it, says Karl Popper.

Recently it feels like I keep having conversations with folks who are afraid of their own imaginations. You know? I'm writing the following list to remind *myself* why I believe you and I both need bullshit. I won't claim itâ€™s original.

1. If you don't value your idea, neither will anyone else.
2. Just because you value your idea doesn't make it valuable to others.
3. Always iterate, because your idea is bullshit.

In my head, the cycle works like this:\
**bullshit > create > iterate**

Good things grow out of manure. Keep at it.
