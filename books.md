I make books for people who read on their phones.


## Read everywhere

Your phone goes everywhere you do. Why are your books stuck on a shelf, or crammed into pinch-and-zoom PDFs?

I don't want an ebook that's an after thought. Do you? 

Don't you want books that are made for your phone? Right from the first draft, through the design and code, that is the book I want to give you. I want you to have maps and photos that *make sense* and look great on the screen you carry in your pocket.

Designers call this the "mobile first" principle. I call it awesome.



## The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing

The Field Guide is my first book. The idea is this: Photographers headed to Beijing really need better info â€“ so I made you something to read on the flight over. The book is written around the questions I heard from visiting photographers most often. You can read a free preview on [Kindle,](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B072FVKP45) or check out <https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing>.
