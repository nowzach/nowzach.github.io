I make books for people who read on their phones.


## Read everywhere

Your phone goes everywhere you do. Why are your books stuck on a shelf, or crammed into pinch-and-zoom PDFs?

I don't want an ebook that's an after thought. Do you? 

Don't you want books that are made for your phone? From the first draft, through the design and code, that's what I want to give you. I want you to have maps and photos that *make sense* and look beautiful on the screen you carry in your pocket.

Designers call this the mobile first principle. I call it awesome.



## The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing

The Field Guide is my first book.

Photographers headed to Beijing really need better info. That's why I made you something for the flight over. Read a preview on [Kindle.](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B072FVKP45)
