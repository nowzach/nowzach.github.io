## The question

How can I help photographers struggling to overcome cultural and logistical challenges when they first travel to Beijing?


## My approach

It took me awhile before I decided to write my book, The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.

Friends and acquaintances occasionally ask me for advice on traveling to China, a country where I've spent a good part of both my childhood and my adult life. This eventually got to the point where I wanted to give people a more in-depth resource. I couldn't find anything suitable, however.

That's when I decided to do something about it.

First, I went back through old emails and messages and collected the questions I'd been asked.

Then, I went online to find more questions. I spent about a year looking through forums, blogs and reviews.

In my research 2 things stood out:

- New visitors talk about feeling overwhelmed and frustrated about traveling in China.
- Misinformation and cultural stereotypes res China among tourists, expats and media catering to those audiences is widespread.

Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. I was. It took me some time to wrap my head around these perspectives.

Trying to describe all of China in a single book seemed crazy. I decided to focus on Beijing. This is one of the most common destinations for folks traveling to China for the first time. It is also my second home, and I know the city pretty well.

In the end, I wrote and then completely rewrote my book to try to address folks whose experiences and concerns were very different to my own.



## Project details

Because of China's formidable internet censorship, I quickly ruled out writing something for the the web. Research and queries to my initial group of Readers led me to thinking about some kind of offline resource.

A reference designed and written for the Reader to use on her mobile phone would be best, I hypothesized.

Based on my research, I created a [user persona]() and a project [style guide.]() Not only did I use these as my "compass" and "map" but I also shared these documents openly with my beta testers, as well as the folks helping me edit the copy and select which photos to include in the book.

## Lessons learned

- This project has been overwhelming at times. What's kept it going? 

  1. I was given rocket fuel: Being told "that'll never work" makes me furious. Since I embarked on this project political tensions and cultural animosity in both my country and China have reached a new high. This pushes me forward. I want my readers to see the complexities of the place, not a media mirage or jingoistic bullshit.
  2. I'm not pushing blindly forward. I steer using reader feedback, as well as that trusty user persona and style guide I drafted a few years back.
  3. The same friends whose questions inspired me to write this book still inspire me.


- Based on reader feedback I will be releasing a major update to the book later this year. To do this I'm re-designing my workflow so that it's more efficient.

- The major focus of the update will be on adding more example photos, and the story of how each came to be made. I'll also be focusing less on describing specific locations and more on cultural and logistical topics.
