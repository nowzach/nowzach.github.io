## The question


The 3-11 Disaster crippled Japan's eel farms. With both Japan and Europe's eel fisheries on the IUCN Red list, where do you go to resupply? Maine, apparently.


## My approach

While house sitting in Maine, I stumbled across something incredible. Eel, a fish that had little local value, had started bringing fishermen more money than their traditional catch.

Having spent some of my youth in Japan, I thought I knew something about eel. I decided to put together an experimental, photo-driven narrative and share it on Instagram.

How would I pique interest in the sprawling story surrounding this fish? I wanted to look beyond the food some of my readers and I associate with childhood and Japan's sticky summer heat. I decided the best way to do this was to bring my readers along for the journey: 

1. I wanted readers to travel coastal Maine with me, as I hiked through the rugged landscape, looking for fishermen.
2. I also wanted readers to join in the research process. This story felt as mysterious as the fish itself, and I wanted to celebrate that. 

Although eel is eaten by cultures all over the world, science still has a lot to learn about the fish. This lack of knowledge seems to have contributed to a worldwide decline in eel. The fish can't be bred in captivity, either. That problem has put Maine and its baby eels on the map as an unlikely but critical supplier to East Asia's eel farms.



## Project details

From the beginning, this story was designed, photographed and written for Instagram.

In total, I published 7 posts for this story.

Each post lead with a 'postcard' -- a photo and a caption. Each post also included 4 phone screenshots from my research. These ranged from recipes, personal recollections and newspaper articles to fishing regulations and scientific reports.

Photographed in April 2017 during elver fishing season.

Published in August 2017 over 3 days leading up to Ox Day, a Japanese holiday when eel is traditionally eaten.



## Lessons learned

Maybe because I failed to include questions or CTAs, participation from Readers was very limited. How disappointing! This failure pushed me to dig deeper into the strategy and language used web and social media marketers. (One of my favorite reads on that topic is Jay Baer's book, 'Hug your Haters'.)

Using my phone instead of a traditional camera was taking things a step too far. Not because the image quality was too low but because I kept running out of battery -- forcing me to choose between shooting and navigating backroads without a map. I chose to get lost, of course.
