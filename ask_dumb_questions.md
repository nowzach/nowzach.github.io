description: Maybe “dumb” questions aren’t so dumb after all?

---


I can admit that I'm embarrassed when I ask a dumb question. Aren't you?

Between speed talkers, jargon lovers and the very vague, sometimes I have to ask a dumb question. I just have to! But, surprisingly, I've learned that I get great answers when I ask a dumb question. These questions are more than an awkward necessity. They are tools you can use to unstick confusing conversations.

Maybe "dumb" questions aren't so dumb after all?



## 3 intentional ways to ask a dumb question

Three ways I like to ask questions, even when it feels a little silly:


### Ask, don't assume

A dumb question isn't the same as being lazy. It is simple but has a clear purpose. Avoid assumptions and ask a question.


### Ask differently

A dumb question isn't the same as changing the subject. It might be surprising but it is not irrelevant. Make room for new info by asking a question.


### Ask again

A dumb question isn't the same as arguing. You might frustrate but ignorance results in much worse. Slow down and ask one more question.



## Ask in 4 steps

1. Be gentle
2. Spend most of your energy listening
3. Ask
4. Make space, and wait for an answer



## Asking dumb questions somewhere else

Using questions this way can be helpful in cross-cultural situations, I think.

"Everything you're sure is right can be wrong in another place." Barbara Kingsolver's "The Poisonwood Bible"

The communication signal:noise ratio falls through the floor when you're in another place. You're overwhelmed. You're under pressure. Just when you need to think critically about your own assumptions – you can't. Heuristics keep tripping you up.

(When you're working across cultures or languages it's just as critical to think about _how_ you ask questions. One of my favorite books on this is Erin Meyer's "The Culture Map.")

Although it took me a few years' worth of awkward conversations after moving back to the US, eventually I did learn that American's reputation for valuing blunt talk holds true. It feels well-represented among both men and women, but maybe skews in favor of business talk a bit. Questions delivered in a straight foward way generally work well, too. (I'm a white dude with an American accent. YMMV.)

Is this because people read your willingness to be direct as "confident," "honest"? You tell me.
